some text to start with

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery, this caption is optional" %}

And some more text afterwards to make sure everything lines up, then a second gallery!

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="This is the second gallery" %}

a new slider:

{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="7" %}
